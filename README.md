Dataset: Heart Disease (UCI Repository - Kaggle)

Objective: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to study variable distribution.

Categorical Variables analyzed using count plots:

Sex (Male/Female)

Chest Pain Type (cp)

Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)

Resting ECG (restecg)

Exercise-induced Angina (exang)

Slope of ST segment (slope)

Number of Major Vessels (ca)

Thalassemia (thal)

Target (num â†’ Heart Disease Severity)

Continuous Variables analyzed using histograms + KDE:

Age

Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)

Cholesterol (chol)

Maximum Heart Rate (thalach)

ST Depression (oldpeak)

Purpose: To observe patterns, distributions, and variations in categorical & continuous features.

Insight: Helps in identifying trends and preparing data for statistical analysis & predictive modeling.
